# windows-Credential-Provider-library
This repository will be updated with all the examples and links that I can find with relevant knowledge &amp; information about CP in MS Windows 7 up to version 10.
### v0.1.2
# Fast brief
Credential providers are the primary mechanism for user authenticationâ€”they currently are the only method for users to prove their identity which is required for logon and other system authentication scenarios. With Windows 10 and the introduction of Microsoft Passport, credential providers are more important than ever; they will be used for authentication into apps, websites, and more.
currently after you you can provide an authentication option for windows Logon-the login screen in the Image below. or a credential picker UI.
